        <p>It's in the Team's goals to design and manufacture each year a new experimental rocket. In the 2022-2023 academic year, PoliTo Rocket Team has two active technical projects: Project Cavour and the Project Efesto. Project Cavour stands for the design and creation of PRT's first rocket, while Project Efesto concerns the research and development of a liquid rocket engine. In the upcoming months, the Team aims to start new projects to upgrade and modernize its technological capabilities, such as thrust vector control and active-fin control.</p>
