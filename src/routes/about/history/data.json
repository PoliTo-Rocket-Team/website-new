PoliTo Rocket Team achieved an important world ranking and won the Technical Award for Innovation for the design and optimization of its 3D printed structural components. \nThroughout the academic year, the Team actively engaged in STEM Outreach, by participating or directly organising them. In particular, the PoliTo Rocket Team organised during the spring the 1st Italian Rocket Engineering Student Summit (IRESS), which was the first occasion for Italy's rocketry student teams to meet up and discuss along with field experts."
